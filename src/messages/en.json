  "lead": "PKT was founded in 2016 and took part in its first competitions within the KartSport Circuit championship. In just a few years, driven by increasing demand and the growth of the project, the team evolved from an amateur spirit into a professional reality—starting with participation in the IAME X30 Italy championship and gradually expanding its commitments and the level of karting competitions it entered, achieving significant results along the way. In recent seasons, thanks to the passion of its founder, Stefano Matteuzzi, and the dedication and hard work of the team, PKT has structured itself to compete in multiple championships within a single season, in order to provide and guarantee a high-level service to its drivers. This has allowed us to broaden our know-how and establish ourselves as a team ready to take on new competitive challenges.Our goal is to grow and develop young drivers, helping them face national and international races with professionalism and discipline. We work in synergy to offer our clients professionalism, quality, efficiency, and elegance—supporting them as they pursue and achieve their dreams.",
